Hi! Welcome to my page! This blog is used to share the knowledge I've learned and I'm happy if it can help someone.

I am a college student from Northeastern University of China. I am also a binary security learner. My main interests are binary exploitation(especially V8 exploitation recently), vulnerability discovery. I always wish to learn more about all these fields and make contribution to them. 

I will graduate in the summer of 2022. I'm looking for a Ph.D or a RA position.:-)

This is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf).
