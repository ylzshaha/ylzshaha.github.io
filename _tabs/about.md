Hi! Welcome to my page! This blog is used to share the knowledge I've learned and I'm happy if it can help someone.

I am a college student from Northeastern University of China. I am also a binary security learner. My main interests are binary exploitation(especially V8 exploitation recently), vulnerability discovery. 

I am always ready to learn some new knowledge. :-)

This is my [CV](/assets/autoCV.pdf).
